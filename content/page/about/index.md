# Mission and motivation

The word logic often provokes fear or hesitation, especially among students in elementary and secondary school. Its reputation - tied to abstract mathematics and dense philosophy - can make it seem intimidating. Yet we all reason logically every day; formal logic is simply the systematic study of those very mental processes.

This blog is devoted to demystifying logic and bringing it to a broader audience. Posts will explore both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of logic, while also delving into its philosophical underpinnings.

To enrich the conversation, this blog will feature interviews with leading scholars and practitioners, presenting diverse perspectives on how logic shapes everything from everyday decision‑making to cutting‑edge research.

> There can be no doubt that the knowledge of logic is of considerable practical importance for everyone who desires to think and to infer correctly.<br>
> — <cite>Alfred Tarski</cite>
